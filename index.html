        <h2 id="page1">C.1. Long Answer Questions: </h2>
        <h5>1. ‘This work, as I see it, has two aspects”.
            What are the two aspects of the works ? Explain in your own words.</h5>
        <p>The two aspects of work are (i) individual works and (ii) social works.</p>
        <p>According to the author Individual work means work on one’s self. This type of work is to follow the urge
            towards moral development as a free person and under self-imposed discipline. Its end-product is a free
            moral personality. On the other hand, social work is work for the society around. The individual can not
            grow in full perfection without social help.
            So, we should get ourselves whole-heartedly engaged in two aspects of work.</p>

        <h5>2. What did Dr Zakir Husain say about material and cultural life,
            individual and social development giving Special flavour to India?</h5>
        <p>Dr.Zakir Husain in his speech has said about material and cultural life,
            individual and social development in India.</p>
        <p> <b>Material and cultural life:</b> Regarding the material life of our people,
            the author says that we should work more and more, our work should be silent, sincere, solid and steady.
            Regarding our cultural life, the author is sincere. He says that our culture is alive and dynamic. Our past
            culture is inherited by our ancient sages right from Aadipurush, Mannu to St.
            Tulsidas. It is still alive and progressing day by day.</p>

        <p><b> Individual and social development:</b> “Regarding individual and social
            development, Dr Zakir Husain, says that both individual and social development of our country is co-related
            to each other. For individual development there are two types of work. One work for personal benefit both
            financial and moral. But for ‘ two type of personal gains one must go to society. The author says
            that the individuality can not grow in full perfection without social help.</p>

        <h5>3. ‘Power should be used only for moral purposes’ Explain.</h5>

        <p>Power plays a dominant role in human society, the power of the manpower
            of society and the power of the state are the main kinds of power.
            According to Mahatma Gandhi power should be used only for moral purposes.
            If a strong man is engaged in work, there is peace. Regarding state power the author says that the state to
            us will not be just an organisation of power but a moral organisation. So, the
            moral purpose of power is essential for all-round development of the society.</p>

        <h5>4. ‘The past is not dead and static’. How does Dr.Zakir Husain emphasises the significance of past?</h5>
        <p>According to Dr.Zakir Husain there is a great significance of our past history. To him, we should pledge our
            loyalty to our past culture. We should not mind from where our past culture came and who brought the
            culture. The important thing is that our past glory is of great value. Our past glory and culture is the
            base on
            which the growth of our national culture and national character depends. </p>

        <p>So, the author is right to say that our past history is not dead and static. It is still alive and dynamic.
            Our prospect of future depends on the importance of past.</p>

        <h5>5. What does Zakir Husain exhort us to do to build the new life of the nation?</h5>
        <p>The author in his speech has tried his best to advise us to labour hard
            to build the new life of the nation. To him, our family of the nation is big. We are continuously growing
            very fast. We shall have to participate in building its new life. He advises the people of India not to sit
            idle. Our work for the nation is hard, but we should not be discouraged. He says that the situation of the
            country demands of us work, work and work more, silent and sincere work, solid and steady
            reconstruction of the whole material and cultural life of our people.</p>

        <h5>6. In what context does Dr.Zakir Husain say ‘Bharat is my home’.</h5>

        <p>In his presidential speech Dr.Zakir Husain expresses his national feelings. He loves his nation. He says that
            he is devoted to the loyalty of our past culture. He also promises to work for the development of our
            ancient culture. He pledges himself to work for the strength of the nation and its progress and for the
            welfare of its people without distinctions of caste, colour and creed. He says that “The whole of Bharat is
            my home and its people are my family”. He is proud of being a citizen of Bharat. He says that it is the
            greatness of the people that they have chosen him to make him the head of this family. He pledges to make
            his home ‘Bharat’ strong and beautiful. He would make the life of the people prosperous and graceful. Here,
            a strong feeling of nationality of the author is clearly expressed.
            Zakir Husain was a great nationalist.</p>

        <h5>(c) Write a speech to be delivered on Teachers’ Day justifying the celebration of Dr Radhakrishnan’s
            birthday as Teacher’s Day.</h5>

        <p>Respected Principal, esteemed teachers, and dear fellow students,</p>
        <p>Today, as we gather to celebrate Teachers' Day, we honor a man whose profound impact on education and
            philosophy continues to inspire generations. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a distinguished scholar,
            philosopher, and statesman, is the embodiment of the ideal teacher.</p>
        <p>It is fitting that we commemorate his birthday as Teachers' Day. Dr. Radhakrishnan was not merely a scholar;
            he was a teacher at heart. He possessed a unique ability to ignite the minds of his students, fostering a
            love for learning and a quest for truth. His teachings transcended the classroom,
            shaping minds and inspiring souls.</p>
        <p>By designating his birthday as Teachers' Day, we acknowledge the invaluable role of teachers in shaping our
            society. They are the architects of our future, molding young minds into responsible citizens. They impart
            not just knowledge but also values,
            ethics, and critical thinking skills.</p>

        <p>Dr. Radhakrishnan's legacy reminds us that a true teacher is more than just a provider of information. They
            are mentors, guides, and friends. They inspire us to reach our full potential,
            to dream big, and to strive for excellence.</p>
        <p>Let us, therefore, take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our teachers. They have dedicated their
            lives to nurturing our minds and shaping our character. Their tireless
            efforts have laid the foundation for our success.</p>
        <p>As we celebrate Teachers' Day, let us pledge to uphold the ideals that Dr. Radhakrishnan embodied. Let us
            strive to be lifelong learners, to seek knowledge,
            and to use it for the betterment of society.</p>
        <p>Thank you</p>

        <h5>(d) You have been elected as the President of your school’s Student Council. Make a diary entry about
            changes you propose to introduce for the betterment of your school.</h5>
        <p>November 22, 2024</p>
        <p>A New Dawn for Our School</p>
        <p>Today marks a significant day in my life. I’ve been elected as the President of the Student Council. This is
            a huge responsibility, and I’m both excited and nervous. I’ve been thinking about the changes I want to
            implement to make our school a better place.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, I want to focus on improving the quality of education. I’ll work with the teachers to
            organize regular workshops and seminars on various subjects to enhance learning. We could also start a
            mentorship program where senior students can guide and help juniors.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I’d like to promote a healthier lifestyle among students. We could organize regular sports events,
            yoga sessions, and health awareness programs. A well-rounded student is a happy student, and physical health
            is as important as academic excellence.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, I want to foster a sense of community and belonging. We could organize cultural events, social
            service initiatives, and inter-house competitions. These activities will not only bring students closer but
            also instill a sense of responsibility and empathy.</p>
        <p>Finally, I want to improve the infrastructure of our school. We could start a campaign to plant more trees,
            maintain the cleanliness of the campus, and upgrade the library and computer lab.</p>
        <p>I believe that with collective effort and dedication, we can transform our school into a vibrant hub of
            learning and growth. I’m eager to work with my fellow students and teachers to bring about positive change.
